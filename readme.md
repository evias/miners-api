# Miners Dashboard
# Lumen 5.4 PHP Web Application

The Miners Dashboard aims to provide an easy-to-use Mining Dashboard for people managing
a lot of Miners, potentially mining on multiple Blockchain Protocols.

The first implementation drafts will work with the [XZC - ZCoin](http://zcoin.finance) Blockchain Protocol
which I have used for mining for quite a time now. This project is nor as a contribution to the ZCoin Project
nor is it for means of Advertising the coin. I have decided to start this implementation with the XZC coin
simply because it's the Blockchain Protocol I have mostly used for mining.

The main idea behind this project is to provide a way to manage Multi Blockchain Mining Farms easily with
a User Friendly Dashboard Web Application.

The application is based on the Lumen Framework. Documentation for the framework can be found on
the [Lumen website](http://lumen.laravel.com/docs).
